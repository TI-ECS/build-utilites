This repository holds small usefull utilities to ease such tasks as build of WLAN packages

wl12xx_build.sh: build WLAN components
======================================
This script compiles one of following utilities: libnl, openssl, hostapd, wpa_supplicant,wl12xx_modules,firmware,crda,callibrator
by calling specific utility name and action.

Usage: wl12xx_build.sh target <
				libnl
				openssl
				hostap
				wpa_supplicant
				wl12xx_modules
				firmware
				crda
				callibrator >  action <download|build|install>
			all
			clean-all

In case the options is 'all' all utilities will be downloaded and installed on root file system.
Option clean-all uninstalls all components and removes their sources from computer.

File setup-env contains all required environment variables:
	ROOTFS=<path to target root file system>
Cross compiler to be used to compile all components:
	CROSS_COMPILER=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
Path to tool chain used to compile sources:
	PATH=$PATH:<toolchain path>
Path where kernel sources can be found
	KLIB_BUILD=< path to kernel build>
Working directory where all necessary sources will be downloaded and compiled
	WORK_SPACE=<path>
Type of target board, used during build of bluetooth, currently supported: "am1808", "omap3evm", "am335x"
	MACHINE_TYPE=
Path where pkg-config utility looks for configuration files (.pc) of libraries
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${ROOTFS}/lib/pkgconfig:${ROOTFS}/usr/lib/pkgconfig
	PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW
	PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}

Path to root file system where new kernel modules will be installed
	KLIB=$ROOTFS
Compiler
	CC=${CROSS_COMPILE}gcc
